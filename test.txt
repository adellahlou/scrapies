{"dataType":"comment","content":"So the basic list of all the weird control structures like coroutines, continuations, async blocks, go blocks, iterator blocks, etc is that they move away from the idea that programming is really about stack machines. Roughly, it amounts to rewriting subsets of the program into continuation-passing style where alternative stacks of execution are stored around in memory.\n\nIt's common to write something like this with callbacks:\n\n(do-something-that-takes-a-long-time (lambda (result) (do-the-next-thing result)))\n\nwhich can be kind of hard to follow. Instead, you'd rather write something like:\n\n(do-the-next-thing (this-may-take-a-while (do-something-that-takes-a-long-time)))\n\nbasically, this-may-take-a-while is the operation that says \"i'm done for now. call me later when you have the information i want\". the 'this-may-take-a-while' operator is equivalent to 'yield', 'await', and go's blocking 'give me a value from a channel' operator.\n\nSo (if you have them) you should probably use alternative control structures in most cases where you're not doing the usual operations with higher-order functions (mapping, reducing, blah blah blah).","time":"2014-03-25T17:49:05+0000","contentid":"688238877889706","userid":"10152025699013038"},

So I am a sophomore who transferred into the major (Weinberg) officially at the beginning of this year. I have taken care of all the core courses except for 213, which I know is essential to almost all of the 300-levels. However, I am currently waitlisted for Dinda's section of 213 this spring due to a very poor reg time, and based on his email response to me, it is unlikely that any more people from the waitlist will be allowed in. How worried should I be if I do not get to take 213 until the fall? (I'm really, really concerned about this right now) Also, I am planning on taking EECS 395: Distrib. Sys. in Challenging Environments w/ Prof. Bustamente next quarter--does anyone know if this can usually be counted towards the Systems Depth course requirement? As per the course manual, under Depth-Systems courses, EECS 395 is listed as \"Appropriate Selected Topics--with advisor approval.\" This is really the only other EECS course I could take next quarter, since everything else requires 213 and most sections of everything are already closed.

In case you haven't done one before, puzzle hunts are competitive team events involving fun problem solving challenges such as ciphers, encrypted codes, wordplay, etc. \n\nAnd why might you care? For starters, prizes for the top teams of 4:\n 1st Place - 4 FitBits\n 2nd Place - $25 Gift cards + mugs\n 3rd Place - $10 Gift cards + shirts\n\nAnd of course, free food from Potbelly's and swag from our awesome sponsor, Avant Credit. \n\nSo bring yo' friends, for some fun CS-themed puzzles with Women in Computing :) Everyone is welcome (males and females, majors and non-majors!) and you'll potentially have cool gadgetry and gloating rights afterwards. There's really no downside here. \n\nPlease RSVP, FB Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/205721256285657/\n\nYay for FitBits!!!\n\nHope to see you next Thursday evening in Wilkinson!","time":"2014-01-24T21:51:38+0000","contentid":"358709957509268_659636107416650","userid":"10201842206535812"},

So, I think the docs are just really old (with some minor revisions), tried to appeal to the AI crowd at the time (and probably still), and could use some rewriting.\n\nOf course, none of this makes the assertions in the docs any \"less wrong\" (there is no doubt that Lisp and others had SMP/Mathematica beat by a long shot).

So, we go to this NYT article (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/us/insurance-site-seen-needing-weeks-to-fix.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&) and see that the source of this figure is \"one specialist.\" The claim sounds dubious at best.\n\nFrankly, I think that this infographic gives undeserved credit to the people involved in the project.

What is a \"line of code\"? Do comments count? Whitespace? Third-party libraries? Is SLOC count even a meaningful metric?\n\nRegardless, it is fun to look at, and I suppose it's interesting to see how codebases have grown over time, but it's easy to just accept the numbers without question; even more so for healthcare.gov, for which many people already harbor a certain amount of disdain.","time":"2013-11-21T18:07:08+0000","contentid":"628795713834023","userid":"10203682332683383"},

Here's what he had to say:\n\nKeepSafe is a once in a decade opportunity, like Instagram: Join a San Francisco startup with insanely high traction, growth and retention and still be among the first ten people.\n\n* Founders are serial entrepreneurs. The team is 100% coders. Stanford Design Masters, EE PhDs, Python contributors. \n* 15m users, 10% monthly growth, 6m monthly actives \n* $3.5m Series A from Floodgate (first investors in Twitter) and SV Angel. \n\nThere are exciting technology and tricky product challenges that we face. We want to bring security, crypto and privacy technology to products that normal human beings understand and care about.\n\nThere's more to KeepSafe than you see in our first product. Here's where we are going: \n* Paper is going away. Printed pictures already don't exist anymore. How do people manage privacy around this? --> KeepSafe. \n* In 5 years nobody will get their bank statements or insurance documents on paper. How will my mum keep these private in an intuitive way? That will be KeepSafe. \n* How can we send photos, documents without generating a perfect copy and give up ownership of this digital object? The technology needs to be built and it will be KeepSafe. \n\nI'd like to know more about you and what drives you. \n* why are you interested in working for a startup? \n* what you want to achieve in your next career step? \n* why would you need to make a career change for that?\n\n* What is your greatest software engineering achievement? \n* What were the challenges you had to overcome? \n* Would you be willing to take a coding challenge?","time":"2013-10-22T19:19:07+0000","contentid":"358709957509268_613195808727347","userid":"10152789220513994"},

This year, I am one of the Tech Co-Chairs and I wanted to reach out and invite you all to apply! \n\nBeing on the committee will be a great opportunity to get some serious HTML/CSS experience - we are looking to build a completely new site off of a customized CSS framework and really bring the foundation up to modern and mobile standards. We'd love to get coders of any experience to help us out.\n\nThe DM Committee Info Session is this upcoming Wednesday, Oct 2nd at 8pm in Leverone, and you can find the application (due Oct 6th) at www.nudm.org !

If you are always forced to write libraries, wrappers, macros and abstractions around the thing, than its semantics are bad and aren't an adequate tool of expression.\n\nNote! That a tool of expression is different from a tool of execution!  Obviously GOTOs make a lot of sense as a tool of execution. Every processor still runs jump commands.  BUT GOTOs do a fantastically bad job as a part of the language that we think of programs in.  So we write abstractions in our language around them to hide them from us.\n\nThe same thing is true of callbacks:  absolutely necessary to execute but you also should never be writing them yourself","time":"2013-09-27T20:39:38+0000","contentid":"600358750011053","userid":"10152849386102806"},

{"dataType":"comment","content":"\"Callbacks, like gotos, aren't evil when they are hidden from you.\"\n\nThat pre-supposes that callbacks are evil if you have to use them, a point which Miguel never justifies. Given that the author equates first-order functions with callbacks, there's an entire world of functional programmers who would probably have a lot to say to him.\n\nThey are a very powerful feature and, yes, they can make things worse if you use them improperly. But simply because someone else uses callbacks wrong doesn't mean that they're bad. That's what makes them fundamentally different from GOTO, where pretty much ANY use was wrong.","time":"2013-09-27T20:58:52+0000","contentid":"600365066677088","userid":"10202729114170458"},
